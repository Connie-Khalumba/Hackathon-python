# Hackathon-python
This project demonstrates efficient solutions to common algorithmic problems using Python. It covers searching algorithms, advanced string manipulation, and sorting algorithms. Each implementation is designed to be concise, readable, and performant.

1. Searching Algorithms
Ternary Search
An implementation of the ternary search algorithm to efficiently locate a specific element in a sorted array. This divides the array into three parts instead of two, optimizing the search in certain cases.

Search in Rotated Sorted Array
A solution to searching in a rotated sorted array, where the array has been sorted in ascending order and then rotated at an unknown pivot point. The algorithm efficiently locates a target value within the array.

2. Advanced String Manipulation
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
A function that determines the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. It efficiently scans through the string to find the optimal solution.

Regular Expression Matching
An implementation of a regular expression matcher that supports two special characters:

.: Matches any single character.
*: Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
3. Sorting Algorithms
Custom Sort
A function that sorts a list of dictionaries based on a specified key, providing flexibility in sorting collections with diverse data types.

Kth Largest Element
An efficient algorithm to find the Kth largest element in an unsorted list. This approach ensures optimal performance for large datasets.
